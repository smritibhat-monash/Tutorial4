## Learning to reference figures

```{r Figref, fig.cap = "This is random noise"}
x = seq(1:100)
y = rnorm(100)
dat = data.frame(x, y)
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
geom_line()
```

The above Figure \@ref(fig:Figref) is some random plot.

## Learning to reference tables

```{r newtable}
dat_tbl <- head(dat,5)
```
The above table \@ref(tab:newtable) is 5 observations of the overall table on which above plot was created
